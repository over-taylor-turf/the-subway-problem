# The Subway Problem ðŸš‡

Create a function called `stopsBetweenStations` that will find the distance between 2 train stations. 

#### There are 3 different subway lines:
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: South Station, Park Street, Kendall, Central, Harvard, Porter, Davis, Alewife
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Government Center, Park Street, Boylston, Arlington, Copley, Hynes, Kenmore
- ðŸŸ  **Orange**: North Station, Haymarket, Park Street, State, Downtown Crossing, Chinatown, Back Bay, Forest Hills

**Important**: all 3 subway lines intersect at **Park Street**, but there are no other intersection points.

The function will be invoked using the following pattern of arguments: `startLine`, `startStation`, `endLine`, and `endStation`.
